ETL Process: Transforming Data from Multiple Sources for Analysis

This process outlines an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that ingests data from two different sources, cleans and transforms it, and ultimately stores it in a centralized location for further analysis.

1. Extract:

* Data is retrieved from two sources:
  * API: Data is extracted from an API using a library like yfinance (for financial data) or a custom API client depending on the specific API.
  * CSV: A CSV file containing relevant data is loaded using pandas.

2. Transform:

* The extracted data undergoes various transformations to prepare it for analysis:
  * Cleaning: Data is inspected for missing values, inconsistencies, and errors. Cleaning might involve imputation, handling outliers, and correcting data formats.
  * Merging: Data from the API and CSV may be merged based on a common identifier (e.g., company ID) to combine relevant information.
  * Calculation of Financial Metrics:
   * Revenue Growth: This involves calculating the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of the revenue data.
   * EPS Growth: Similar to revenue growth, CAGR is calculated for the earnings per share (EPS) data.
   * PE Ratio: The price-to-earnings ratio (PE) is computed by dividing the stock price by the EPS.
   * Future Price Estimates: Based on the calculated growth rates and current financial metrics, estimates for future revenue, EPS, and stock prices are generated. This might involve extrapolating trends or using more sophisticated financial modeling techniques.

3. Load:

* The final, transformed data containing the above-mentioned financial metrics and estimates is loaded into a centralized storage location:
  * Storage Account: Azure Blob Storage is a common option, allowing efficient storage and retrieval of large datasets. Other cloud storage options like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage can also be used.

Benefits:

Centralized Data: This process ensures consistent and readily available data for analysis, eliminating the need to manage data from scattered sources.
Improved Data Quality: Cleaning and transformation steps improve data quality, leading to more reliable and insightful analysis.
Actionable Insights: The calculated financial metrics and future price estimates provide valuable insights for investment decisions, financial forecasting, or other data-driven applications.
Scalability: The ETL process can be automated and scaled to handle larger datasets efficiently.
This ETL pipeline provides a structured approach to integrate and prepare data from diverse sources, transforming it into valuable financial metrics and estimates for further analysis.
